*** Rocket Pack************************************

Project Synopsis
--------------------

Rocket pack is a development board based around the MSP430FR5739 microcontroller
and the Digi Xbee S3B Pro 900MHz zigbee radio.  The board is intended to 
facilitate broadcasting real time, high-rate sensor data over a range of several
hundred meters.  The board is designed to interface with custom built sensor 
packages, or with the TI sensorTag development board running custom firmware


Power Supply
----------------------
The board has on-board battery management designed specifically for single cell
lipo batteries, but will also take any voltage source between 3.3V and 5VDC.
The regualted 3.2V rail is availible on all three expansion headers as well as 
the CCdebugger header, which is designed specifically to power the sensorTag
development board.   



Communications
----------------------
The MSP430FR5739 contains two hardware USART's.  One USART is reserved for the
zigbee radio, while the other is broken out to both the serial data header and 
the ez430 programming/debug header.  All signals reqired for I2C, SPI or UART 
are availible on the serial data header



SensorTag
----------------------




 Errata
 ---------------------
 
 V0.1:
       Debug header location:  The location of the debug header interferes with 
       nearby pin headers, making it impossible to populate the debug header 
       with a right angle header and .1" pitch pin header.
       
       Specified load capacitors on the crystal are wrong.  The crystal will 
       stabilize on boot, but will not remain.
       
       Radio CONFIG pin is wired to MCU to allow easy entrance into command
       mode.  This should be connected to a different pin.
       
       
       
TO DO
------------------------

1.  MS430Firmware:  1.  Startup sleep mode -> poll mag and exit on high value
                    2.  Startup procedure -> broadcast calibration data
                    3.  Startup procedure -> read radio ID to store UID
                    4.  TX mirror         -> Prepend UID to TX'd packets
                    
2.  SensorTag       1.  Clean up firmware  -> remove deadwood
                    2.  
                    
3.  Labview         1.  Radio interface  ->  AT command mode control to select
                                             radio to listen to
                    2.  Sensor interface ->  Formalize calibration code
                    3.  Sensor interface ->  Formalize data processing
                    4.  Sensor interface ->  Add "remote globals"
